LIVE
=============
LIVE is an open-source, browser-based web-conferencing system.  

It supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with Notepad controls), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.  

Sessions can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

The educational use cases for LIVE are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)

LIVE must be installed on a Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit server. It is based on BigBlueButton core technology. [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install)
